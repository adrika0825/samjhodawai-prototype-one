# SamjhoDawai – Prescription Simplifier for the Elderly

-SamjhoDawai is a healthcare-focused AI-assisted tool designed to help elderly and non-English-speaking users understand handwritten medical prescriptions. The platform simplifies complex medical instructions into easy-to-understand explanations in regional languages.


-SamjhoDawai is a B2C healthcare web prototype that helps elderly users understand handwritten medical prescriptions in simple regional languages.

## Problem
Handwritten prescriptions and complex medical terminology often confuse elderly and non-English-speaking patients, leading to medication errors.

## Solution
Users upload a photo of a prescription, enter basic details (age, weight), and select their preferred language.  
The system extracts medicine instructions, simplifies them, checks basic safety conditions, and generates a clear daily schedule.

## Key Features
- Handwritten Prescription OCR (API-based)
- Regional Language Simplification
- Age & Weight-based Safety Flagging
- Time-based Medication Schedule
- Interactive Medical Chatbot

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- APIs: OCR API, LLM API (no custom training)
- Database: MongoDB (or session-based storage)
  

## Tech Stack (Prototype)
Frontend: React (UI for uploading/viewing prescriptions)
Backend: Node.js + Express (API for prescription analysis)
AI Logic: Rule-based / ML-assisted text interpretation (prototype-level)



## Status
This is a hackathon prototype focused on demonstrating end-to-end workflow and problem-solving.
## Prototype Status
This is an early-stage prototype focused on validating logic and safety flows.
UI and OCR are mocked for hackathon feasibility.
